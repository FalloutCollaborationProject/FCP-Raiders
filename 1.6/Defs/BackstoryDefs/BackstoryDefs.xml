        <description>While most raiders aren’t among the most subtle human beings and usually prefer to wipe out all who dare oppose them, [PAWN_nameDef] had a different approach. [PAWN_pronoun] realized that it was much more profitable to beat victims into submission and sell them to the highest bidder and [PAWN_nameDef] was scarily good at it.</description>

        <description>Somewhat uncommon for a raider, [PAWN_nameDef] had a perfectly functional instinct for self-preservation. [PAWN_pronoun] always preferred to shoot people from a distance, instead of running towards them, screaming profanities and insults, just to get shot immediately. Some other raiders have thought of this as cowardly, but [PAWN_nameDef] methods were proven right as [PAWN_pronoun] outlived them all.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was part of a raider group which camped close to a road often frequented by caravans.

Eventually most members of [PAWN_possessive] raider gang tore each other apart after quarrelling over some especially valuable loot they pried from some trader’s corpse. [PAWN_nameDef] was one of the few survivors.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was once part of a thriving settlement community. The prosperous settlement attracted the attention of a nearby raider gang which wanted to loot the place, as raiders usually do. [PAWN_nameDef] proposed a bargain to the raiders, [PAWN_pronoun] would leave the settlement’s gates unbarred in exchange for a share of the loot and the permission to join the gang. The raiders agreed and the settlement was sacked and torched. [PAWN_nameDef] became a part of the gang, but the other raiders never really trusted [PAWN_objective]. Afterall, [PAWN_pronoun] already betrayed [PAWN_possessive] once.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] used to live in a settlement under strict control of a paramilitary militia that ruled almost every aspect of the townspeople’s lives. One day [PAWN_pronoun] had enough and fled from the town and its oppressive regime to take up arms against it. [PAWN_nameDef] became a raider not out of greed or sadism, but out of sincere belief in anarchistic ideals. This idealism often put [PAWN_objective] at odds with other raiders, but through [PAWN_possessive] eloquence, [PAWN_pronoun] managed to persuade many of them to go after the oppressors, not the oppressed.</description>

[PAWN_pronoun] made sculptures composed of severed heads impaled on metal spikes, pictures painted with blood and other unsavoury creations. Most other raiders of [PAWN_possessive] gang were terrified of [PAWN_objective] and rightly so, especially when [PAWN_possessive] was running low on “art supplies”.</description>

While [PAWN_pronoun] recently reduced [PAWN_possessive] chem intake, [PAWN_nameDef] had no intention of stopping altogether, since in battle, the drugs made [PAWN_objective] a force to be reckoned with.

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] grew up among one of the more warlike tribal societies. At some point, even [PAWN_possessive] couldn’t tolerate [PAWN_possessive] bloodthirsty and reckless behaviour and [PAWN_pronoun] was banished, leaving [PAWN_objective] no choice but to join a band of raiders, who were more appreciative of [PAWN_possessive] “talents”.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was abandoned as an infant and left in the wasteland to die. A group of raiders stumbled upon the child and decided to take the baby with them. Lucky for [PAWN_nameDef] the group was among the more civilised and they raised [PAWN_objective] as one of their own.</description>

        <description>One day, while rummaging around in some ruins surrounding [PAWN_possessive] gangs raider camp, [PAWN_nameDef] found some old cans of spray paint. While [PAWN_pronoun] most certainly would have called [PAWN_objective]self an artist, most [PAWN_pronoun] spray-painted were tags of the gangs logos an various profanities.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] grew up in a raider camp. [PAWN_possessive] task was to clean up after the raiders, to cook for them, and to patch them up after they were shot to pieces. In time, the other raiders grew to respect [PAWN_objective], as they realized their shoddy hideout would fall apart without [PAWN_possessive] work.</description>
